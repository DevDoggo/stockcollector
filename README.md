# stockcollector

This was some program I wrote a year ago as my first Flask project. I got pretty far into it but abandoned it down the road for whatever reasons. Full functionality is probably not to be expected, but it does what I set out to do:
>Scrape stockmarket data on a specific tag for specific dates
>Render graphs in the web-application for the data
>Use flask as its framework
